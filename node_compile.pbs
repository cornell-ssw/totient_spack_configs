# I assume you already checked spack spec -I
# Launch with:
#
#     qsub -v spec='python+tk' /share/apps/spack/totient_spack_configs/node_compile.pbs
#
# NOTE: Make sure you are underneath *YOUR* home directory, when running from
#       underneath /share/apps/spack it couldn't copy the .oXXXX output file back
#       due to insufficient permissions.
#
# NOTE: Better yet, just put the `spack_node_install` function in your ~/.bashrc and
#       launch
#
#       spack_node_install 'python+tk'
#
#       from anywhere you please ;)  Read the docs:
